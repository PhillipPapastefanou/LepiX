# The LepiX Model

## Modelling impacts of genetically modified organisms on non target insect species 

This project was initially developed by the Federal Agency of Nature 
Conservation and the University of Landau. A detailed model description 
can be found in [Fahse et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018300152?via%3Dihub) or Otto et al. 2023. A full model 
description can be found in [Fahse et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018300152?via%3Dihub).
The model was initially designed to simulate maize pollen deposition on 
butterfly larvae, but is in principle able to simulate any type of insect 
larvae and pollen deposition.

## Known Issues 

 * The automated postprocessing scripts based on RDotNet do currently not work with R versions greater than 3.6
 * The graphical user interface including the interactive manual display currently only works on Microsoft Windows.
